OmniMail is a simple extension to improve your productivity when sending emails with GMail™. Instead of opening GMail and creating a new mail, you simply type `mail` into the omnibox/address bar followed by one or multiple email addresses. You can also search through your Google contacts.

## Localization
To translate OmniMail to your language, fork the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/harpyon/OmniMail) and edit the _locales/xx/messages.json file to match your language.
